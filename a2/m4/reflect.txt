3) Many menu options that were created required to search for a contact before
being able to make changes to it. This would mean we would have repeated 
a lot of code if we did not create a search function which we can call on.
If we every need to make a change to the searching algorithm, we would
only need to do it in one place. The getTenDigitPhone function has a lot
of logic to make sure the number is valid, and it is used in multiple places.
By putting this logic in a function, it makes the main code much easier to read
and it is much easier to maintain. 

4) What I learned is that, the development process for this project is much
faster using functions as we did then it would have been if we put everything
in one place. Everything was broken up into smaller problems making it
easy to know what to code in what spot (the function names gives that 
away). When a bug is spotted while testing,it is easy to know where the
bug could possibly be located. Futhermore, any time we needed the 
code, we refer to it by its name. At this point the code becomes a
black box. If this was a team project, all the others have to do is 
read comments provided to know what it does.
