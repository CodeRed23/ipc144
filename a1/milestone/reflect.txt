1) 
- One small thing could be done for convienience (in my opinion) could removing
the prompt asking the user whether of not they have that information. The reason 
is because if the info is not aplicable, they could just press the enter key
without typing anything and that will create a empty string. However, it only 
works with strings and not the integers, so it will not be a perfect change.

- There is a way to allow scanf to take multiple values at once making it 
possible in some cases to input their full name all on one prompt. However, this
is not perfect because it will be very difficult to program if a part of the
 name has spaces in it (example: last name is more than one word for example like 
the sample output: Wong Song). It could be programmed so that there is 
a dilimeter to denote(plain character) the end of a string and the start of 
the next but that will be hard to force on the user. It is also easy for the user 
to make a mistake by not separating their strings correctly when they are 
prompted to input.  

2) A C string always needs to be capable of storing 1 more than the meaningful
amount of characters to allow the null terminator ('\0') to be stored at the end
of the string. The null terminator is important as that's the computer's
way of knowing the end of a string in memory.
