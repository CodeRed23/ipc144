1) I believe the assignment asked me to create a struct contact that holds three other structs was to 
organize the code in a much better format. By having three separate structs in the last at home milestone, it would
force the programmer to have to create parallel arrays if they choose to create more contacts since 
information is spread out on multiple structs that contain info about one entity (contain related data).  
By having one struct containing everything about that contact, you will only need one array of structs (type 
contact) if you want multiple contacts. This makes it easier to work with the data as you only need to
use the member access operator (the dot). It will also save memory as there is only one array rather then multiple of them.
In short, it cleans up code as well as future proofs it when we decide to expand the amount of contacts.

2) The most difficult part of the assignment was trying to preserve whitspace in a string, before this assignment
I never realized I never inputted a string with a space so I never come across this problem before. It is also
when I learned that scanf can read a character class (regular expression).  

3) Milestone 4 took me approximately 2.5 hours.
