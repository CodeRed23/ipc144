1) The advantages of using an array a structs is that it cleans up code a lot
because instead of using mulitiple arrays which all have to called on one to
collect data you only need to call on one where thee element in each array
encapsulates more than one data type. Another advantage is that you can save
yourself from a lot of wasted space if you were to declare mulitple
arrays and not use some of the allocated space you declared for each. Code 
also far easier to understand when it is cleaned up by structures

2) If you were working on a bigger project that requires mulitple c source files
or separate projects that coincidentally require the same name and info on
a structure, putting the structure declaration in a header file allows the 
programmer to only need to declare the structure once and make any neccassary
changes to the stucture once and you still able to use it anywhere
as many times as they please. This cleans up code as well as saves a lot of time.
